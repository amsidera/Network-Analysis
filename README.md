# Network-Analysis

# Introduction
Proyects developed during the course online social network analysis. In this course, we explored the latest algorithms for analyzing online social networks, considering both their structure and content. Fundamentals of social graph theory will be covered, including distance, search, influence, community discovery, diffusion, and graph dynamics.



# Proyects
1. Collecting a political social network: The goal is to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of the accounts of 4
U.S. presedential candidates from the previous election.

2. Community detection and link prediction algorithms: using the relationships between facebook users of Bill Gates. I cluster the resulting graph into communities, as well as recommend friends for Bill Gates.

3. Recommendation systems: Implement a content-based recommendation algorithm using the list of genres for a movie as the content.

4. Text classifier: I build a text classifier to determine whether a movie review is expressing positive or negative sentiment. The data come from the website IMDB.com.
