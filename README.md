# Network-Analysis

# Introduction
Proyects developed during the course online social network analysis. We explored the latest algorithms for analyzing online social networks, considering both their structure and content.



# Proyects
1. Collecting a political social network: The goal is to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of the accounts of 4
U.S. presedential candidates from the previous election.

2. Community detection and link prediction algorithms: using the relationships between facebook users of Bill Gates. I cluster the resulting graph into communities, as well as recommend friends for Bill Gates.

3. Recommendation systems: Implement a content-based recommendation algorithm using the list of genres for a movie as the content.

4. Text classifier: I build a text classifier to determine whether a movie review is expressing positive or negative sentiment. The data come from the website IMDB.com.
